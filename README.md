# Where are all the repositories?

I'm in the process of moving my code off of GitHub, for a variety of reasons,
which I will talk about on [my blog][blog], eventually. Meanwhile, see
[GiveUpGitHub][sfc:giveup] and [Free Software Needs Free Tools][mako:free-tools]
for some of the reasons of my departure.

 [sfc:giveup]: https://giveupgithub.org/
 [mako:free-tools]: https://mako.cc/writing/hill-free_tools.html
 [my-gitea]: https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon

Repositories are being migrated to my own [Gitea instance][my-gitea], you'll
find them there. Below is a non-exhaustive list of my things that used to be
hosted on GitHub, but no longer are:

- [riemann-c-client](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/riemann-c-client)
- [poki-pona](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/poki-pona)
- [Model01-sketch](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/Model01-sketch)
- [potential-happiness](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/potential-happiness)
