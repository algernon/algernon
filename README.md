# Where are all the repositories?

I have moved my code off of GitHub, because GitHub no longer serves my needs, to say the least. On top of all that, being a free software person, I believe that [Free Software Needs Free Tools][mako:free-tools]. So I moved my repositories to [my own forge][my-forge], you'll be able to find them there. Below is a non-exhaustive list of things that used to be here, but no longer are:

 [mako:free-tools]: https://mako.cc/writing/hill-free_tools.html
 [my-forge]: https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon

- [riemann-c-client](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/riemann-c-client)
- [poki-pona](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/poki-pona)
- [Model01-sketch](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/Model01-sketch)
- [Model100-sketch](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/Model100-sketch)
- [potential-happiness](https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/potential-happiness)

I only moved my own repositories. I still have a GitHub account - obviously, since you're reading this -, and will maintain that until I work on, or contribute to projects that are hosted there. If for some odd reason you're interested in what I'm doing, you can check [my forge][my-forge], it even has an RSS feed. Or, you can follow me on the [Fediverse][mhp:fedi], or check [my blog][mhp:blog].
